# The Deltafy Handbook

## Overview

**This handbook serves as a fundamental guide about Deltafy and its core values.**

## Story

Deltafy is conceived in 2023 by two (2) people who envisioned 

This handbook serves as a guide on what Deltafy is all about, what it tries to achieve, and how it is going to achieve and materialize its visions. In addition, this also serves as a guide on the culture that it aims to cultivate

## Culture

The core to every successful venture is not a brilliant business model or product, but the culture it tries to mold.

We believe that everyone in Deltafy is a **leader**. To do so, **autonomy** must be granted for everyone to be one.

By autonomy, we believe at everyone's ability to steer their own ships while staying on the right direction. Specifically, we believe:

* at everyone's ability to take ownership.
* at everyone's ability to exercise self-leadership.
* at everyone's ability to trust their judgments.
* at everyone's ability to make informed decisions and intuitions.
* at everyone's ability to express themselves freely.
* at everyone's ability to take initiative.
* at everyone's ability to stay resilient in times of ambiguity and uncertainty.
* at everyone's ability to provide, learn from, and absorb constructive criticism.
* at everyone's ability to acknowledge universal morals, regardless of religion, culture, and political inclinations.

Contrary to popular belief, the idea of a _high-performing team_ is not made through rigid structure and a strict playbook. A team's success should not be measured only by the value they brought in the table, but also the individual satisfaction that everyone receives in the game.

There is beauty in chaos, and the beauty of nature itself is built from chaos. All magnificient things in nature share one thing in common: they are all formed by the coalescence of atoms with diverse intrinsic properties.

In the context of teams and organizations, we believe in the idea of natural selection. In other words, we believe that successful teams are made out of diverse and autonomous individuals who make efforts in giving mutual respect, aligning their values, and encouraging open communication.

**Idealism** and **Pragmatism** are complementary traits that everyone in Deltafy must possess. The primary mechanical force that will guide Deltafy in its pursuit is everyone's ability to balance these two contrasting aspects.

Everyone must be able to exercise and express brilliant ideas, solutions, and visions, regardless of how unrealistic they may be. At the same time, everyone must be pragmatic enough to examine the faults and errors in their abstract ideas, and must be open enough to constructive criticism. 

Just like Deltafy is founded by individuals who since aimed to make an impact and change the world, everyone must aim for making the world a better place and everyone's lives better than it should be.

At the end of the day, the culture that Deltafy tries to foster is not a salary. However, it is the culture that we could certainly say is not parasitic of its constituents, but rather puts mutualistic growth as its utmost priority.

## Methodology

### Basics

We are strong believers of the Lean Startup Methodology and the IBM Garage Methodology. The upcoming sections mostly take inspirations from these two approaches.

### Ideation

We do not believe in a perfect business plan.

Business plans rely on untested hypotheses and only the true conception of a product or service can test these hypotheses. In other words, a successful venture is only defined by its execution.

In the case of ideation, we trust everyone's judgment to evaluate his/her own idea, introspect for errors, and objectively foresee its future impact and potential.

There are also frameworks you can utilize for evaluating ideas. There is the [ICE framework](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/ice-scoring-model/), Bryan Eisenberg's [TIR framework](https://www.bryaneisenberg.com/3-steps-to-better-prioritization-and-faster-execution/), and many others. Once again, it is up to your personal judgment on how you evaluate your ideas.

At the end of the day, we look at every idea as a set of hypotheses that must be tested. Thus, it is not highly necesary to come up with a very comprehensive business plan. It is highly important that an idea should not stay untested for too long, and practical uncertainties must be gradually cleared over time.

### Product Development

In general, product development is an iterative cycle of building, upgrading, testing hypotheses, and responding to user feedback and demands.

Specifically, when building products or pursuing projects, a feedback-driven lifecycle is encouraged. This is for the purpose of what is called **validated learning** (i.e. validating an idea directly from customers or users). This is employed in methodologies like Scrum and Agile.

In addition, we should not be afraid of embracing a state of _"forever beta"_. The idea of a perfect product is a myth.

We should not be afraid of [doing things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) when left with no other feasible options.

We also believe in **chaos engineering** as one way to test reliability. While it is not yet applicable at the current scale of Deltafy, failure can be engineered when possible, and one can make ways and plan for [deterministic chaos](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/complexity/CompLexicon/chaos.html).

To conclude this section, it is important to emphasize that it is paramount for people to gain satisfaction from the things they do while building things sustainably. In this case, we believe that everyone must be given the flexibility and opportunity to build until they manage to achieve satisfaction and take pride in the things they manage to accomplish, while still keeping one's ownership and responsibility in mind.

## Experimentation

Deltafy is not your typical startup. We encourage the adoption of frameworks and best practices. However, we also believe that strong adherence to convention impedes an individual's openness towards new ideas and lessens room for growth. 

We believe in the need to _responsibly_ unleash from structure and authoritative knowledge to achieve true innovation. We believe that innovation is a set of processes that must take place to achieve true metamorphosis.
