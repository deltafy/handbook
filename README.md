# The Deltafy Handbook

## Overview

**This handbook serves as a fundamental guide about Deltafy and its core values.**

## Culture

The core to every successful venture is not a brilliant business model or product, but the culture it tries to mold.

We believe that everyone in Deltafy is a **leader**. To do so, **autonomy** must be granted for everyone to be one.

By autonomy, we believe at everyone's ability to steer their own ships while staying on the right direction. Specifically, we believe:

* at everyone's ability to take ownership.
* at everyone's ability to exercise self-leadership.
* at everyone's ability to use good judgments.
* at everyone's ability to make informed decisions and intuitions.
* at everyone's ability to express themselves freely.
* at everyone's ability to take initiative.
* at everyone's ability to stay resilient in times of ambiguity and uncertainty.
* at everyone's ability to learn and relentlessly strive for growth.
* at everyone's ability to provide, learn from, and absorb constructive criticism.
* at everyone's responsibility to exercise universal morals, regardless of religion, culture, and political inclinations.

### Team Structure

Contrary to popular belief, the idea of a _high-performing team_ is not made through rigid structure and a strict playbook. A team's success should not be measured only by the value that individuals bring in the table, but also the satisfaction that every individual receives in the game and playing with the team.

There is beauty in chaos, and the beauty of nature itself is built from chaos. All magnificient things in nature share one thing in common: they are all formed by the coalescence of atoms with diverse intrinsic properties.

In the context of teams and organizations, we believe in the idea of natural selection. In other words, we believe that unbreakable team cohesion is built around chaotic systems, and chaotic and disorganized teams naturally amalgamate. 

We highly believe that a very effective team is made out of diverse and autonomous individials who know how to lead themselves, advocate for open communication, build mutual respect, and make efforts in aligning values.

### Culture of Thinking

Everyone is a **thinker**.

In this case, our culture of thinking revolves around two fundamental schools of thought: **Idealism** and **Pragmatism**.

We believe that an idealism and pragmatism are complementary traits that everyone in Deltafy must possess. The primary mechanical force that will guide Deltafy in its pursuit is everyone's ability to balance these two contrasting aspects.

Everyone is encouraged to exercise and express brilliant ideas, solutions, and visions, regardless of how unrealistic they may be. At the same time, one should retain the pragmatism that is needed to introspect and examine one's own faults and errors, especially in one's own abstract ideas. 

Constructive criticism is also essential and everyone must be open to receiving and learning from it. No mental realms shall remain unmerged and unexamined.

It is recommended to practice the [Socratic Method](https://lucidphilosophy.com/chapter-4-socratic-method/) and the [Harkness Method](https://www.exeter.edu/excellence/how-youll-learn) when discussing ideas.

### World View and Ethics

Deltafy is founded by individuals who since aimed to make an impact and change the world.

It is indispensable for everyone in Deltafy to aim for making the world a better place and making everyone's lives better than it should be.

Every human being has the natural innate capacity to distinguish what is universally moral. There is no need for debate to discuss what is right and wrong.

In circumstances where peace may not be an option, whether it is due to a living or a non-living threat, one must make efforts to protect humanity from subjugation and uncompromising evil.

## Methodology

### Basics

We are strong believers of the Lean Startup Methodology and the IBM Garage Methodology. The upcoming sections mostly take inspirations from these two approaches.

### Ideation

We do not believe in a perfect business plan.

Business plans rely on untested hypotheses and only the true conception of a product or service can test these hypotheses. In other words, a successful venture is only defined by its execution.

In the case of ideation, we trust everyone's judgment to evaluate his/her own idea, introspect for errors, and objectively foresee its future impact and potential.

There are also frameworks you can utilize for evaluating ideas. There is the [ICE framework](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/ice-scoring-model/), Bryan Eisenberg's [TIR framework](https://www.bryaneisenberg.com/3-steps-to-better-prioritization-and-faster-execution/), and many others. Once again, it is up to your personal judgment on how you evaluate your ideas.

At the end of the day, we look at every idea as a set of hypotheses that must be tested. Thus, it is not highly necesary to come up with a very comprehensive business plan. 

It is important that an idea should not stay untested for too long. If testing is not possible, uncertainties must be gradually cleared over time.

### Product Development

In general, product development is an iterative cycle of building, upgrading, testing hypotheses, and responding to user feedback and demands.

Specifically, when building products or pursuing projects, a feedback-driven lifecycle is encouraged. This is for the purpose of what is called **validated learning** (i.e. validating an idea directly from customers or users). This is employed in methodologies like Scrum and Agile.

We also believe in a **fail fast-fail safe** culture. Failures are supplementary and such failures are only considered failures if there is nothing to learn from them. One must fail safely whenever possible.

We believe in the necessity of **chaos engineering** when testing a system's reliability. While it is not yet applicable at Deltafy's current scale, we are open to ideas of engineering one's way to failure when it is possible and when it is necessary for growth and testing resiliency. The only rule is to engineer [deterministic chaos](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/complexity/CompLexicon/chaos.html).

The idea of a _perfect product_ is also a myth. One must not fear embracing a state of _"forever beta"_. However, one must not also be foolish to not recognize sunk-cost fallacy.

We should also not be afraid of [doing things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) when left with no other feasible options, especially when it is the only way to test a hypothesis.

### Work

Time is a finite resource that each and every one of us who are bound to the laws of nature must manage. In the context of work, we trust everyone's ability to use their own good personal judgment in managing it.

It is paramount for people to gain satisfaction from the things they do. In this case, everyone must be granted the flexibility and opportunity to build until they manage to achieve satisfaction and take pride in the things they manage to accomplish. The only rule is to build sustainably and take ownership.

### Experimentation

While we encourage the adoption of frameworks and best practices, we also believe that strong adherence to convention impedes one's openness towards new ideas and lessens the room for growth.

True innovation is the painstaking process of experimentation, not having full certainty of whether an experiment will be highly successful or not. To adhere to this definition of innovation, we believe in the need to _responsibly_ unleash from structure and authoritative knowledge.

## Footnote

At the end of the day, the culture that Deltafy tries to foster is not a salary or incentive. However, we can say with certainty that this is a form of culture that does not parasitize its constituents, but rather prioritizes holism and mutualistic growth.

We are all ships sailing towards the same horizon.
